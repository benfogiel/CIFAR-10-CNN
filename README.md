# CNN for the CIFAR-10 Dataset

- Simple Deep Convolutional Neural Network optimized for the CIFAR-10 Dataset
- Currently achieving 84 % accuracy

Usage:
- Clone this repo
- Working from the main repo directory, run ```conda env create -f environment.yml```. This will create a virtual environment containing the necessary dependencies
- Activate the virtual environment by running ```conda activate cifar``` (Anaconda is required)
- Then train and validate the model by running ```python3 main.py```
