# CNN for the CIFAR-10 Dataset

- Simple Deep Convolutional Neural Network optimized for the CIFAR-10 Dataset
- Currently achieving 84 % accuracy

To use:
- Clone this repo
- Download the CIFAR-10 Dataset by downloading the ```data``` folder from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e5-RlYp6ClPGPhTfxqRB7i-MkNPM6-8J?usp=sharing)
- Paste the ```data``` folder into the main repo dir
- From the main repo dir, run ```conda env create -f environment.yml```. This will create a virtual environment containing the necessary dependencies
- Activate the virtual environment by running ```conda activate cnnDemo```
- Then run the model by running ```python3 main.py```
